Hereâ€™s a concise **README** for your JWKS Server Project repository:

# JWKS Server Project

This project implements a simple JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) server using Python's Flask framework. The JWKS server generates RSA key pairs, serves the public keys through a well-known endpoint (`/.well-known/jwks.json`), and provides an authentication endpoint (`/auth`) to issue JWT tokens signed by the private keys.

## Features
- **RSA Key Generation**: Automatically generates RSA key pairs with an expiration period.
- **JWKS Endpoint**: Serves a set of public keys through the `/jwks.json` endpoint in compliance with the JWKS format.
- **Authentication**: Issues JWT tokens signed with the generated RSA private keys through the `/auth` endpoint.
- **Token Expiration**: Supports both valid and expired tokens for testing purposes.

## Endpoints
1. **GET** `/.well-known/jwks.json`:  
   Returns a JSON Web Key Set containing public RSA keys that are used to verify the JWTs.

2. **POST** `/auth`:  
   Generates a JWT token. Supports query parameter `expired=true` to generate an expired token.
   
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `expired` (optional): Set `expired=true` to receive an expired JWT.
   - **Response**: 
     - JSON response with a signed JWT token.
